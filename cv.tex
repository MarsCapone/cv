\section{About}
I am a keen programmer interested in autonomous robots and swarm intelligence, reading Computer Science at the University of Southampton. I am very persistent and reliable in the tasks I decide to do - if I say I will do something, I will definitely do it. I am currently working on a clustering bot for \href{https://robotgame.net}{RobotGame}, and I am a volunteer for Student Robotics.

\section{Experience \& Projects}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{Feb. 2016 -- May. 2016}
     {COMP2211 Coursework}
     {Software Engineering Group Project}

Team leader in a group project to create a demo marking application for roadside driver assessments at Heathrow airport. The application was written in Java, and we used agile methods such as scrums, and sprint sessions to great success.

\item{Mar. 2016}
     {COMP2212 Coursework}
     {Splat Programming Language}

Created a functional programming language, written in OCaml, as part of a group coursework. This was my first moderate sized project using a functional language. Following on from this success, I am working on an extension to Splat.

\item{Oct. 2013 -- Jul. 2014}
     {Valere Capital Partners}
     {IT Support}

Installed and maintained computer equipment and software. Worked on upgrading the office network connection, and setting up VoIP for the office. Learned to be systematic in fault-finding, and experienced working under pressure with users who were keen to have their problems solved quickly.

\item{Jan. 2014 -- Jul. 2014}
     {Dragon Hall Youth Centre}
     {3D Printing Coordinator}

Partially built and maintained 8 3D printers. Was involved in getting young people (ages 8 - 16) interested in, and able to use 3D printers.\\
Over the course of various demonstrations and fundraising events, I became much more confidant at presenting my ideas, and with public speaking.

\item{Jan. 2014 -- Jun. 2014}
     {Clerkenwell Primary School}
     {Code Club Volunteer}

Taught 15 children ages 10 to 11 how to make games using the Scratch programming language. Later we also moved onto the basics of Python. I learned to be flexible when dealing with groups of mixed ability.

\item{Oct. 2012 -- Jan. 2013}
     {Run by University of Southampton}
     {National Cipher Challenge}
     
I compiled and led my team, the aptly named Winning Combination, to first place. Involved solving 8 pairs of increasingly difficult ciphers, with the final cipher (a modified trifid) taking 44 hours and 20 minutes to solve. We won Â£1000, of which we donated 20\% to Code Club.

\section{Extracurricular}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{2014 -- Present}
     {University of Southampton}
     {Student Robotics}

I am part of Student Robotics, a charity involved in getting 6th formers to build and program autonomous robots. I am currently involved in creating a Django based scheduler for competition roles. I have also participated as a volunteer at competition for the past two years, and have mentored three teams. I am also the secretary of the Southampton branch.

\item{2014 -- Present}
     {University of Southampton}
     {Toastrack Bus}
     
I am the webmaster of the Toastrack Bus society, a small group of students who manage and try to maintain a 1920s bus. More information at http://toastrackbus.org.

\item{2014 -- Present}
     {University of Southampton}
     {Code Dojo}

I am a regular member of the Southampton Code Dojo, a monthly meetup of tech individuals, coding some challenge in just over an hour. So far I have written a Mondrian-style art generator, a story generator, and a project to find and separate clusters on a graph. My usual language is Python.

\item{2016}
     {University of Southampton}
     {Ballroom Dancing}
     
In early 2016 I learned ballroom dancing, and participated in a competition after only a month. I did not come last, which I consider to be a great success.  
     

\item{At some point}
     {All over the place}
     {Sports \& Hobbies}

I enjoy less traditional activities such as circus skills. I am fairly competent at unicycling, juggling and diabolo. When I have time I go long distance walking, skiing or sailing. I have walked the length of Hadrian's wall and the North Norfolk Coastal Path. I spent the summer of 2013 becoming a ski instructor, and I have also participated in a 6 week tour of the Peloponnese and the Tall Ships races.
